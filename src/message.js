    text: "Hello Kurtney, this is a message to you for expressing my gratitude and admiration. It's composed of the littlest bits of my backstory of what occurred to me this year.",
  },
  {
    text: "Writing this epistle is difficult for me because I'm showing my fragility. However, I entirely trust you and show what I really am.",
  },
  {
    text: "You may not know this, but I've suffered from mild depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and loneliness throughout the year. Of course, it's all self-diagnosed. I've researched what is wrong with me, and then, viola, look what I've found. ",
  },
  {
    text: "Life has been heavy. There were many moments when I felt tired, lost, and close to giving up.",
  },
  {
    text: "Some days felt pointless. Some nights felt endless. All the things I used to love became meaningless. Every task felt hefty to do. If you imagine a normal person doing their laundry, it's just 5% of their energy, while for me it takes 10 times that.",
  },
  {
    text: "During the day, I distracted myself with games, anime, and programming. But inside, nothing felt real. At night, it was worse. I cried silently. I questioned my worth. Agonized by the circumstances. My thoughts never stopped talking loudly while listening to comforting music. ",

    text: "Sometimes I wanted to reach out to you, however, I resist myself. I knew you were also carrying heavy plates too. I didn't want to add some additional burden to you. ",

  },
  {
    text: "That is why sometimes when you're beside me, I'm always daydreaming, looking from afar, and distancing myself from people. I've become more irritated towards people and every small inconvenience. ",
  },
  {
    text: "You may see that I'm still excelling in school, but I've barely wanted to go and just want to isolate myself from the whole world. I've become a 'high-functioning depressed' person because I have no other choice but to always move forward even if my brain is freaking tired of doing so.",
  },
  {
    text: "In the middle of September, I told myself: this is enough. I didn't want to stay trapped in my own mind. I started taking small steps to get out of this loop.",
  },
  {
    text: "I became gentler with myself. I go outside so I can see the world. I walk and walk to different places. I let my body move so my mind wouldn't take over. I look for ways to improve myself.",
  },
  {
    text: "You introduced and showed me what 'persistence' looks like. You may not realize it, but you became one of the reasons I kept going. Not because you fixed everything, but because I saw how you move forward despite everything life throws at you.",
  },
  {
    text: "Your presence reminded me that I wasn't alone. You inspire me because I know your struggles, and yet you keep moving forward, taking action towards your goal, and always hoping for the best. You're always optimistic in life and bring positivity when you talk to me, or just feel your presence beside me.",
  },
  {
    text: "You gave me strength without forcing it. You gave hope without promises.",
  },

    text: "That's why when you ask for something, I always try my best to fulfill it. Seeing you happy matters to me. Your reactions are precious, and they mean more than you know 💖",

    text: "From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being part of my life. I truly appreciate you. Becoming your friend healed me in ways I can't fully explain. Thank you for existing 🤍",
  },
  {
    text: "I intensely admire your persistence and the way you exist. And just by existing, you've became one of my aspirations.",

    text: "I'm super proudly to say I survived the battles on my mind before it consumes me wholely.",

  {
    text: "Throughout the year. We fought our own brutal battles.",
  },
  { text: "Some days felt endless, some nights unbearable." },
  {
    text: "Yet, even in the darkness, we found the smallest sparks of light. Of moments of laughter, of courage, of quiet persistence. Every challenge tested us, pushed us to our limits, and yet, here we are.",
